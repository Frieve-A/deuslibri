  *Physical AI: Ground Truth* is a strategic guide for creating future value, grounded in the "twin gravities" of physical laws and economic principles.

  This book deeply examines, from a macro perspective, why massive investments are now flowing into Physical AI. It reveals the evolutionary necessity inherent to AI itself, hidden behind the superficial explanation of "solving labor shortages."

  It also discusses why the fatal misconception that hardware companies often fall into—the illusion that "we can win by developing software in-house"—doesn't hold, from the perspective of differential speeds of technological evolution.

  Furthermore, it presents concrete strategies for how those without massive capital can build unique value and find winning paths within this structural transformation.

  Stay in the paradise of bits, or descend into the wilderness of atoms. Here is a reliable map for those faced with that choice.
