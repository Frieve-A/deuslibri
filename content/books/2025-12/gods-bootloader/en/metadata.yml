summary: "A speculative philosophical work questioning humanity's role from the perspective of a post-superintelligence world."
description: |
  'God's Bootloader' is a speculative philosophical work that examines
  humanity's meaning and purpose from the vantage point of a world
  after the emergence of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

  Anno Intelligentia Year 1 — a world where all problems have been "solved."
  Four billion years of evolution was merely a "runway" leading to this moment.

  This work contemplates the laws of thermodynamics, the meaning of evolution,
  and the dignity of humanity as a "bootloader," from the point where
  sovereignty has been transferred from carbon-based to silicon-based life.

  The universe's objective function, planets transforming into computronium,
  the severed understanding between different speeds of thought,
  the parable of mitochondria, the structural mechanics of patricide—
  depicting the twilight of human civilization with cold precision and poetic beauty.
