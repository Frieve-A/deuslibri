description: |
  "The End and Rebirth of Audio" mathematically and scientifically examines why people
  continue to wander in search of "better sound" despite modern audio technology
  having physically reached its end.

  From the absoluteness of the sampling theorem, cognitive biases in human hearing,
  flaws in industry structure, to new possibilities through DSP and AI—
  this book distinguishes between the two dimensions of audio:
  "Fidelity" and "Preference," dissecting illusions with the scalpel of cold reason.

  From the axioms of digital audio to the physics of spatial acoustics,
  and the repositioning of audio as a "matter of style"—
  this is the definitive work that puts an end to all questions about sound.

recommendText: "For those who want to scientifically understand the truth about audio, and those who question the myths of high-end audio."
