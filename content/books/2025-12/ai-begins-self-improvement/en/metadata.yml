description: |
  "2025—AI Begins Self-Improvement" is a book that explains 2025—the year when the acceleration of AI research and development entered a phase of "accelerating the acceleration itself"—through the lens of four exponential loops.

  The self-improvement loop (AI improves AI), the environment generation loop (synthetic data destroys data scarcity), the computational capital loop (computation begets computation), and the top-level decision-making loop (AI sets the objective function)—this book reveals the structure where these four loops interconnect and begin spinning as closed exponential development.

  AlphaEvolve, AI Scientist-v2, Genie 3, GR00T N1, Stargate, SKAI—rather than chasing individual news items, this book provides a framework for understanding why progress doesn't stop: its recursive structure.
